# SPEC_DEFENDERNAV.md — Defender Navigator
### Exotopia · Cosmic Scene Navigation Strip
*SCD Hub · exotopia.org · living document — May 2026*

## 0. Reference & Philosophy

The **Defender Navigator** (DefenderNav) is a persistent horizontal minimap strip inspired
by the 1981 Williams Electronics arcade game *Defender*, in which a narrow strip across the
top of the screen showed the full 360° planet landscape — enemies, humanoids, terrain — at
all times, even when the player's viewport was zoomed in on one small region.

In Exotopia the strip serves the same spatial-clarity role: **you are always inside a scene
that is larger than your viewport.** Whether you're standing on an exoplanet surface
(surrounded by 360° of alien sky), orbiting inside a star system (surrounded by 3D orbital
space), or navigating the cosmic web — the DefenderNav shows you the whole world you are
inside, with your camera position marked, and lets you jump anywhere in it.

The additional innovation: **the strip is also a portal interface.** Clicking an object that
requires a scene change does not just pan the camera — it triggers the E8 wormhole transit
animation, so every navigation gesture that crosses a scene boundary feels like genuine
spacetime transit.

### 1.1 Strip dimensions

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Width | 100% of page width |
| Height | 80 px (desktop) · 64 px (mobile ≤ 480 px) |
| Position | Fixed, bottom of viewport, above bottom controls bar |
| Z-index | 8 (above Three.js canvas, below WormholePortal overlay 9900) |
| Background | `#010810` with subtle horizontal scan-line texture (CSS repeating-gradient, 2px period, opacity 0.07) |
| Border-top | 1 px solid `rgba(0, 180, 220, 0.18)` |

### 1.2 Header bar (12 px tall, above canvas area)

Left side — breadcrumb showing current scene level:

```
◈ COSMIC  ·  Coma Supercluster          ◈ GALAXY  ·  Stellar Neighborhood
◈ SYSTEM  ·  Kepler-442                 ◈ SURFACE ·  Kepler-442b
```

Right side — strip controls:

```
[─────────────] zoom slider    2.4×    ⊟  collapse/expand toggle
```

The collapse toggle shrinks the strip to a 20 px bar (header only). Clicking the header bar
when collapsed re-expands to full height. State persists per session in `localStorage`.

### 1.3 Canvas area (remaining height below header bar)

This is a `<canvas>` element drawn every frame by the parent page's Three.js tick loop via
`defenderNavRef.value?.redraw(data)`. It renders the spatial overview in one of three modes.

### 1.4 Scale indicator

Right side of canvas, vertical: a faint ruler with 2–4 labelled tick marks indicating the
spatial scale of the current strip viewport. Updates when the user zooms the strip.

## 2. The Three Scene Modes

### 2.1 `system` mode — GalaxyPage (system view)

**What the strip shows:** A 2D top-down projection of the orbital plane, stretched to fill
the full strip width.

**Coordinate mapping:**
- X-axis (strip width): orbital angle 0°→360°, wrapping. Strip width = 360° of the orbital
  plane. At zoom 1×, the full orbit circle is visible. At zoom 4×, only a 90° arc fills the
  strip, and the user scrolls left/right.
- Y-axis (strip height): radial distance from host star, log-scaled. Star sits at strip
  centre-bottom. Outer orbits sit near strip top.

**Objects rendered:**

| Object | Visual | Colour | Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| Host star (single) | Radial gradient glow, 8px radius | Spectral from `st_teff` | Hostname |
| Tight binary pair | Two overlapping glows co-rotating; combined 10px glow envelope | Each star's spectral colour | "[host] AB · _n_ d" (period) |
| Wide circumstellar companion | Smaller glow, 6px, at companion orbital radius | Companion spectral colour | "[host] B" |
| Trinary outer companion | Smallest glow, 4px, at very wide radius | Companion spectral | "[host] C" |
| Forbidden zone (circumbinary) | Hatched horizontal band from Y=bottom to Y=forbiddenR | `rgba(180, 60, 30, 0.12)` diagonal hatch | "UNSTABLE" at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Planet — circumstellar (S-type) | Filled circle 3–5px + glow ring | `planetHex(eqt, au)` | Planet name |
| Planet — circumbinary (P-type) | Filled circle 3–5px + outer ring + small AB marker | `planetHex(eqt, au)` with amber tint | "[name] ·⟡" at zoom ≥ 2× |
| L4 marker | Upward triangle ▲ 6px | `rgba(60, 220, 100, 0.75)` | "L4" at zoom ≥ 3× |
| L5 marker | Downward triangle ▽ 6px | `rgba(255, 180, 30, 0.75)` | "L5" at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Moon orbit arc | Dashed arc around planet dot | `rgba(160, 180, 200, 0.4)` | "Moon I/II…" at zoom ≥ 4× |
| Settlement dome | Hexagon outline ⬡ 7px | `rgba(0, 200, 220, 0.9)` | "Settlement" at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Gallery — art | Rotating diamond ⬠ 7px + slow outer ring spin | `rgba(200, 120, 255, 0.9)` violet | Gallery name at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Gallery — community hall | Rotating diamond ⬠ 7px + outer ring | `rgba(255, 200, 60, 0.9)` gold | Gallery name at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Gallery — research station | Rotating diamond ⬠ 7px + pulse | `rgba(60, 220, 180, 0.9)` teal | Gallery name at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Gallery — DJ stage | Rotating diamond ⬠ 7px + rhythm pulse | `rgba(255, 60, 180, 0.9)` hot-pink | Gallery name at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Gallery — info hub | Rotating diamond ⬠ 7px static | `rgba(140, 200, 255, 0.9)` sky-blue | Gallery name at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Gallery — LIVE meeting | As above + fast outer ring pulse + presence badge `[n]` | Type colour at 1.0 opacity | "[name] · LIVE" always |
| Gallery — locked | Diamond outline only (no core), ✖ badge | Type colour at 0.35 opacity | "[name] · LOCKED" |
| Gallery — NFT exclusive | Diamond outline + ⚿ key badge | Type colour at 0.55 opacity | "[name] · NFT" at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Camera position cursor | Blinking ▽ 9px white + cyan glow | `#00e5ff` | "YOU" in tiny text |

**Camera cursor position:**
The cursor X = the 3D camera's azimuthal angle around the **system barycentre** (computed
from `camera.position` projected onto the orbital XZ plane → `atan2(x - baryX, z - baryZ)`
→ mapped to strip X). For single-star systems barycentre = star position. For multi-star
systems barycentre is computed from `stellarConfig` mass ratios (see §2.4). The cursor Y =
3D camera radial distance from barycentre (log-scaled). Blinks at 1.4 Hz.

**Orbit rings:** Each planet gets a thin dashed horizontal line across the full strip width
at its Y-position (its orbital radius, measured from the system barycentre). The dashes are
`rgba(40, 80, 120, 0.35)`. The current selection's ring is solid `rgba(0, 180, 220, 0.55)`.
Circumbinary planet rings use `rgba(255, 160, 30, 0.45)` (amber) to distinguish P-type
orbits visually from S-type.

**Strip pan:** When zoom > 1×, the strip shows a sub-arc of the full 360°. The visible
window tracks the camera cursor by default (auto-follow), keeping the cursor in the centre
third of the strip. The user can grab and drag the strip horizontally to override auto-follow
for 3 seconds before it re-engages.

---

### 2.4 Multi-star system rendering

The strip handles four stellar configurations, classified by the `stellarConfig.type` field
passed in `systemData`. The classification is resolved in the parent page from NASA archive
fields and a known-circumbinary lookup table before `redraw()` is called.

#### Classification cascade

```
sy_snum === 1                     → 'single'
sy_snum === 2
  known circumbinary catalog hit  → 'circumbinary'
  innermost pl_orbsmax > threshold → 'circumbinary'  (heuristic)
  otherwise                       → 'circumstellar'
sy_snum === 3
  has circumbinary inner pair     → 'hierarchical_triple' (circumbinary inner)
  otherwise                       → 'hierarchical_triple' (circumstellar inner)
sy_snum >= 4                      → 'circumstellar' with annotation "N-star system"
```

**Circumbinary heuristic threshold:** If `sy_snum === 2` and the innermost planet's
`pl_orbsmax` exceeds `4 × estimatedBinarySeparation`, classify as circumbinary. When binary
separation is unknown, a default of 0.2 AU is assumed (typical short-period binary). This
catches e.g. Kepler-16 (innermost planet at 0.7 AU), Kepler-34 (1.09 AU), Kepler-47c (0.99 AU).

**Known circumbinary lookup:** A small compile-time `Set<string>` of confirmed circumbinary
hostnames from the NASA confirmed planets list (Kepler-16, Kepler-34, Kepler-35, Kepler-38,
Kepler-47, Kepler-64, Kepler-413, Kepler-453, Kepler-1647, TOI-1338, etc.). Takes precedence
over the heuristic.

---

#### Case A — `'circumstellar'` (S-type): wide companion, planets orbit primary

```
Y (distance from barycentre, log-scaled)
│
│  ···················  companion orbital radius (maybe off-strip at zoom 1×)
│
│  ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─  planet c orbit ring
│  ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─  planet b orbit ring
│
●  ★  primary star glow               ✦  companion glow (at companion angle)
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── X (orbital angle 0→360°)
```

- Primary star drawn at strip centre-bottom.
- Companion drawn at its current orbital angle X and its orbital radius Y.
- Companion orbits the barycentre slowly — period typically years to millennia, so drift
  is imperceptible within a single session unless the orbit period is < ~1 year.
- Planets orbit the primary; their orbit rings measured from primary, not barycentre (since
  companion is far). L4/L5 marked relative to primary as normal.
- Companion is a valid click target: fly-to brings the 3D camera toward the companion's
  position in the scene. No settlement possible at companion (no planets).

---

#### Case B — `'circumbinary'` (P-type): tight pair, planets orbit both

```
Y (distance from barycentre, log-scaled)
│
│  ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─  planet b orbit ring (circumbinary, amber)
│  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  forbidden zone band (hatched, red-amber)
│
●  ★★ co-rotating pair                               ★★ (wrapped)
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── X (orbital angle 0→360°)
```

**Co-rotating pair rendering:**
Both stars drawn near the centre-bottom, offset from barycentre by `massRatio`:

```
primaryX   = barycentreX - sin(binaryAngle) * r_primary_from_bary * stripScale
companionX = barycentreX + sin(binaryAngle) * r_companion_from_bary * stripScale
```

where `r_primary_from_bary = separation × massRatio / (1 + massRatio)` and
`r_companion_from_bary = separation × 1 / (1 + massRatio)`.

The two star dots rotate around the central barycentre X at their binary orbital period.
At default zoom 1×, the separation may be sub-pixel — the two dots appear merged into one
double-core glow. At zoom ≥ 4×, they become visibly distinct and the rotation is clear.

**Period label:** The header bar appends `·⟡ AB  P = _n_ d` next to the system name when
a circumbinary system is active, e.g. `◈ SYSTEM  ·  Kepler-16  ·⟡ AB  P = 41 d`.

**Forbidden zone:** A hatched horizontal band (diagonal lines at 45°, 3px spacing,
`rgba(180, 60, 30, 0.12)`) fills from Y=0 (star layer) to Y = forbiddenZoneRadius on the
strip. No orbit rings exist inside this band. At zoom ≥ 2×, the top edge of the band carries
the label "UNSTABLE ZONE · < _n_ AU".

**Circumbinary planet orbit rings:** Drawn in amber `rgba(255, 160, 30, 0.45)` to distinguish
from circumstellar rings. Each planet dot carries a tiny ⟡ badge at zoom ≥ 2× indicating
it orbits both stars.

**L4/L5 for circumbinary planets:** L4/L5 Lagrange points exist relative to each
circumbinary planet and the **combined stellar mass** acting as the "primary body". The
triangle markers are drawn at ±60° from each circumbinary planet dot, same visual treatment
as circumstellar L4/L5. The tooltip notes "circumbinary L5 — orbital zone around Kepler-16b".

---

#### Case C — `'hierarchical_triple'`: inner tight pair + distant outer companion

The strip combines Cases A and B:
- Inner pair rendered exactly as Case B (co-rotating tight glow, forbidden zone).
- Outer companion rendered as Case A companion: single glow at very wide orbital radius.
- At zoom 1×, outer companion may be at the far edge of the strip or beyond it (label still
  appears at the strip edge as a clipped arrow `► [host] C  _n_ AU`).
- Planets may be:
  - Circumbinary around the inner pair (drawn as Case B planets).
  - Circumstellar around one inner star (rare and dynamically unstable; drawn in
    `rgba(220, 100, 50, 0.7)` red-orange to flag marginal stability).

**Trinary breadcrumb header:** `◈ SYSTEM  ·  [host]  ·⟡ AB+C  3-star`.

---

#### Case D — `'contact'` (touching/merging binary)

Contact binaries have an orbital period of < 1 day and stars that share their outer
envelope. Exoplanets in contact binary systems are rare but confirmed.

- The two stars are drawn as a single elongated glow (two overlapping radial gradients,
  no gap between centres) at the strip centre-bottom.
- The combined object pulses gently (opacity ±0.15 at ~0.5 Hz) reflecting the photometric
  variability typical of W UMa / EW-type contact binaries.
- Label: `"[host] (contact)"`.
- Planets orbit the combined mass as if a single body; orbit rings and L4/L5 drawn normally.
- Forbidden zone: not drawn (contact binaries have a very short separation — the entire
  system well fits inside a single pixel at zoom 1×).

---

#### Y-axis barycentre reference for all multi-star cases

The strip Y-axis always measures distance from the **system barycentre**, not from the
primary star. This keeps planet orbit rings in their physically correct position relative
to what both stars are orbiting.

For Cases A and C (wide companion), the barycentre is very close to the primary (since
the companion is far away and typically less massive). The barycentre offset = companion
separation × companionMass / (primaryMass + companionMass). For most systems this is
< 5 AU, which at the strip's log-scale is indistinguishable from the primary position —
no visible distortion.

For Case B (tight pair), the barycentre offset is significant and visually important —
this is what creates the apparent back-and-forth swaying of the two stars in the strip.

---

### 2.2 `surface` mode — SurfaceViewPage

**What the strip shows:** The full 360° sky horizon, compressed into the strip width.
This is exactly the Defender model — the planet surface extends in all directions, and the
strip shows the whole visible sky at once.

**Coordinate mapping:**
- X-axis: azimuth 0°→360°, wrapping. 0° = North (right-side-up geographic convention).
  At zoom 1×, the full 360° sky is visible compressed.
- Y-axis: altitude (–10° to +90°). Strip centre = horizon (0°). Strip top = zenith (90°).
  Objects below –10° are invisible (below terrain line).

**Terrain line:** A faint horizontal jagged line at altitude 0° using terrain
heightmap data, giving the strip a silhouette look — the signature Defender aesthetic.
Drawn as a small-amplitude noise wave in `rgba(60, 100, 60, 0.5)`.

**Objects rendered:**

| Object | Visual | Colour | Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| Host star (single or contact) | Radial gradient glow 10px | `starColorFromTeff(teff)` | Hostname + phase |
| Tight binary pair (circumbinary host) | Two overlapping glows 8px each, angular separation tracks binary phase; combined envelope 12px | Each star's spectral colour | "[host] A · [host] B" stacked |
| Wide circumstellar companion | Glow 5px, independent azimuth/alt arc | Companion spectral colour | "[host] B · comp." |
| Trinary outer companion | Glow 4px, very slow arc | Coolest spectral | "[host] C" |
| Exomoon I/II/III | Circle 4px + glow | Moon palette colour | "Moon I" etc. |
| Sibling planet | Circle 3px | `planetHex(eqt, au)` | Planet name |
| Settlement dome | Hexagon ⬡ 6px (at azimuth 0°, alt 0°) | `rgba(0, 200, 220, 0.9)` | "HOME" |
| Pyramid / L5 conduit | Small ▲ 5px amber | `rgba(255, 200, 40, 0.9)` | "TRANSIT" |
| Orbital gallery (any type) | Tiny spinning diamond ⬠ 5px at current sky azimuth + altitude | Type colour at 0.65 opacity | Gallery name at zoom ≥ 3× |
| Orbital gallery — LIVE | As above + outer ring pulse | Type colour at 0.9 opacity | "[name] · LIVE [n]" always |
| Camera look-direction | Vertical cursor line, full strip height | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)` | Blinking |

**Multi-star sky behaviour in surface mode:**

*Tight binary (circumbinary surface):*  
Both stars rise and set together — their combined barycentre traces a single arc across the
sky. The strip shows two dots displaced by a small angular offset (< 1° at typical
circumbinary planet distances) that slowly revolves at the binary orbital period. At zoom 1×
the two dots are likely merged; at zoom ≥ 4× the rotation of the pair becomes a visible
oscillation. The terrain silhouette may show a subtle double-shadow transition zone when
one star rises before the other.

*Wide binary (circumstellar surface):*  
The companion star traces its own independent arc at a different speed. Its azimuth/altitude
is computed from its full orbital position (period likely years → near-stationary in a single
session). It appears as a bright "star" that barely moves during play, analogous to a very
slow "super-sun" in the sky alongside the primary.

*Hierarchical triple:*  
Primary pair behaves as tight binary above. Outer companion behaves as wide binary companion
above. Three distinct arcs — or two merged + one independent — visible in the strip.

**Camera look-direction cursor:**
The camera's horizontal look angle (yaw) maps to strip X (azimuth). The cursor is a vertical
line spanning the full strip height, with a horizontal field-of-view bracket drawn at the
horizon altitude — showing the current camera FOV arc.

**Sky arc:** As time advances (or the slider moves), all sky objects glide smoothly left
across the strip, tracking their azimuth in real time.

**Auto-follow:** The strip X auto-scrolls to keep the camera look-direction cursor centred.
User drag overrides for 3 seconds.

---

### 2.3 `cosmic` mode — CosmicPage

**What the strip shows:** A 2D XZ-plane projection of the cosmic web (the same projection
used in the Three.js scene from above).

**Coordinate mapping:**
- X-axis: scene X position (Mpc scale), centred on Milky Way.
- Y-axis: scene Z position, centred on Milky Way. (Y-axis of Three.js scene = up, not shown.)

**Objects rendered:**

| Object | Visual | Colour | Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| Milky Way | Star glyph ✦ 8px | Amber `#ffd480` | "Milky Way" |
| Named galaxy cluster | Circle 3–5px (richness-scaled) | Cluster `color` | Name at zoom ≥ 3× |
| X-ray cluster | Dot 2px | `colorHex` from catalog | — |
| Wormhole conduit | Diamond ◆ 4px pulsing | Cyan `#00e5ff` | "Conduit" at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Active event cluster | Dot + beacon ring | Event type colour | Event title at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Cosmic void | Faint outline arc | `rgba(20, 40, 80, 0.5)` | Void name at zoom ≥ 2× |
| Camera position | `◇` 8px, blinking | White | "YOU" |

**Auto-follow:** Strip camera cursor follows the 3D camera XZ position, keeping it
centred in the visible window.

---

### 2.5 Orbital Gallery Stations

Gallery stations are permanent objects positioned in defined orbital zones around the host
star system — not on any planet surface, but floating in space at a specific orbital radius
and angle. They are a distinct level of the spatial hierarchy (between Level 3 star system
and Level 4 planet surface) and are the primary venue for virtual meetings, art exhibitions,
community events, and information sharing.

In the DefenderNav strip, galleries appear in all three modes:
- **System mode**: diamond markers ⬠ at their orbital radius and angle in the strip
- **Surface mode**: slow-drifting diamond dots in the sky strip at their current azimuth/altitude
- **Cosmic mode**: (future scope) cluster-level galleries not shown at this scale

---

#### Gallery types and ownership models

**Five gallery types**, each with a distinct purpose, visual colour, and default content policy:

| Type | Icon colour | Primary purpose | Default access |
|---|---|---|---|
| `art` | Violet `rgba(200, 120, 255, 0.9)` | Rotating $ART NFT exhibitions, visual portfolios, gallery events | Public browse, gated mint |
| `community` | Gold `rgba(255, 200, 60, 0.9)` | Group meetings, workshops, cultural ceremonies, assemblies | Member NFT |
| `research` | Teal `rgba(60, 220, 180, 0.9)` | Eco-ops field data dashboards, mentor networks, learning hubs | Open or team-gated |
| `stage` | Hot-pink `rgba(255, 60, 180, 0.9)` | Live DJ sets, $BARS music events, sound performances | Ticket NFT |
| `info` | Sky-blue `rgba(140, 200, 255, 0.9)` | Persistent knowledge base, project documentation, onboarding | Public |

**Three ownership/governance models:**

| Model | Who controls content & access | How earned/acquired |
|---|---|---|
| `solo` | One NFT deed holder — the gallery owner | Eco-ops milestone reward OR purchase on pon.ink marketplace |
| `cooperative` | 2–12 co-owners; majority vote via pon.ink DAO module | Multi-sig deed shared by a group (e.g. OT Kulcha collective) |
| `dao` | DAO governance token holders — threshold vote | Community-wide governance; funded by community pool or pon.ink revenue share |
| `public` | Curated by SCD Hub admin; no deed required | Permanent public infrastructure; anyone enters freely |

---

#### Orbital positioning

Galleries occupy one of three position types, encoded in `OrbitalGalleryEntry.orbitAnchor`:

**Free orbit** — gallery at a specified AU radius, independent of any planet.
```
orbitAnchor: { type: 'free', radiusAU: 1.8, initialAngleDeg: 45 }
```
Gallery orbits the star/barycentre at its radius. Orbital period derived from Kepler's third
law: `T_years = radiusAU^1.5`. In a session, angle advances:
`angleDeg += (360 / (T_years × 365)) × dtDays`

**Lagrange anchor** — gallery locked to a planet's L4 or L5 point.
```
orbitAnchor: { type: 'lagrange', planetName: 'Kepler-442b', point: 'L5' }
```
Gallery angle = `planet.orbAngle − 60°` (L5) or `planet.orbAngle + 60°` (L4). Gallery
inherits the planet's orbital radius. The gallery co-moves with the planet — in the strip
it sits at a fixed angular offset from the planet dot, making the Lagrange relationship
immediately visible. The ▽L5 triangle is drawn behind/below the gallery diamond.

**Binary orbit** — gallery orbiting the circumbinary barycentre in a system with a tight pair.
```
orbitAnchor: { type: 'circumbinary', radiusAU: 3.4 }
```
Only valid for `stellarConfig.type === 'circumbinary'`. Gallery orbit ring drawn in amber
(matching circumbinary planet rings). Particularly significant: a gallery at a circumbinary
L5 point orbits the *combined stellar mass*, making it genuinely exotic as a real estate type.

#### Meeting states and strip animation

| State | Strip visual | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|
| `idle` | Diamond at 0.4 opacity, no rotation | "Empty · [last active] ago" |
| `open` | Diamond at 0.75 opacity, slow rotation (1 rpm) | "Open · Enter freely / with access" |
| `live` | Diamond at 1.0 opacity, fast rotation (4 rpm), outer beacon ring pulse | "LIVE · [presenceCount] inside · [title]" |
| `locked` | Diamond outline only, ✖ badge, 0.35 opacity, no rotation | "Locked · Session in progress · [host]" |
| `exclusive` | Diamond outline + ⚿ badge, 0.55 opacity | "NFT Required · Acquire on pon.ink" |

**Presence count badge:** When `meetingState === 'live'` and `presenceCount > 0`, a small
number badge is drawn to the upper-right of the diamond: white circle 8px radius, count
in 7px monospace black. At zoom 1× the badge may overlap neighbouring objects — culled
if strip pixel width < 12 px per object.

**Scheduled event countdown:** When a gallery has a `scheduledEvent` with a future `startUtc`,
the strip shows a faint dashed orbit ring that slowly brightens as the event approaches —
reaching full opacity 15 minutes before start, then transitioning to `live` state on start.
The tooltip shows the countdown: `"Opens in 2h 14m · [event title]"`.

---

#### Access control and NFT gate

The current user's access level for each gallery is resolved by the parent page before
`redraw()` from the user's connected wallet NFT inventory (via pon.ink auth):

```
'owner'   → user holds the Gallery Deed NFT for this gallery
'member'  → user holds a Membership NFT for this gallery
'ticket'  → user holds a time-limited Event Ticket NFT
'public'  → gallery is open to all / user has no specific NFT but gallery is public
'none'    → user has no qualifying NFT; gallery is gated
```

**Gallery Deed NFT address format:**
```
exo-orbital-gallery-v1:[hostname]:[orbitAU_x100]:[slotIndex]
e.g. exo-orbital-gallery-v1:Kepler-16:180:0
```

**Click behaviour by access level:**

| User access | Gallery state | Strip click result |
|---|---|---|
| `owner` / `member` / `ticket` | any open state | Portal zoom-in → gallery interior `/gallery/:hostname/:galleryId` |
| `public` | `open` or `idle` | Portal zoom-in → gallery interior |
| `none` | `open` | Tooltip: "Access Required · Acquire on pon.ink" + [pon.ink link button] |
| any | `locked` | Tooltip: "Locked by [owner] · Session in progress" — no portal |
| `none` | `exclusive` | Tooltip: "NFT Required · [gallery name] · [pon.ink link]" |
| `owner` | `locked` | Tooltip: "[YOU locked this] · Click to unlock" → emits `unlockGallery` event |

The `unlockGallery` event is handled by the parent page which calls the pon.ink API to
update meeting state. No portal fires for a locked gallery.

---

#### Gallery breadcrumb and deep-link route

When the user enters a gallery via the DefenderNav, they navigate to:
```
/gallery/:hostname/:galleryId
```

The header breadcrumb updates to:
```
◈ GALLERY  ·  [gallery name]  ·  [hostname]
```

The DefenderNav strip in gallery mode shows a special `gallery` sub-mode: a 2D floor plan
of the gallery interior rendered in the strip. The Y-axis = depth into the gallery, X-axis
= lateral position. Camera cursor shows where the user is standing inside the gallery.
Artworks / information nodes appear as labeled dots. This is the **Level 3.5** view —
below the star system orbital strip (Level 3) and above the planet surface strip (Level 4).

The strip header breadcrumb stacks to:
```
◈ COSMIC › GALAXY › SYSTEM  ·  Kepler-16  › GALLERY  ·  [name]
```

Navigation back up the hierarchy via breadcrumb clicks (each fires a portal transit to the
parent level).

#### Gallery route in the DefenderNav emit system

```typescript
// gallery-specific flyTo target
interface DefenderTarget {
  type:   'planet' | 'lagrange' | 'moon' | 'star' | 'azimuth' | 'cluster' | 'gallery'
  id:     string
  // for gallery type:
  galleryId?:    string
  hostname?:     string
  accessLevel?:  'owner' | 'member' | 'ticket' | 'public' | 'none'
  meetingState?: GalleryMeetingState
}
```

Parent handles `gallery` targets in `onDefenderFlyTo`:
```typescript
if (target.type === 'gallery') {
  if (target.accessLevel === 'none') {
    // Show access-denied tooltip — no portal
    showAccessDenied(target)
    return
  }
  if (target.meetingState === 'locked' && target.accessLevel !== 'owner') {
    showLockedTooltip(target)
    return
  }
  // Valid access → portal
  portalStore.openPortal({
    label: target.id,
    route: `/gallery/${target.hostname}/${target.galleryId}`,
  })
}
```

### 3.1 Zoom

The strip has its own independent zoom factor, stored in component state.

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Mouse wheel over strip | Zoom in/out centred on cursor position |
| Pinch gesture (mobile) | Zoom in/out |
| Zoom slider (header) | Direct zoom control, range 0.5×–8× |
| Double-click on strip | Zoom in 2× centred on clicked point |
| Double-right-click | Zoom out 2× |

**Zoom range:** 0.5× (sees 2× the full world — duplicated wrap) to 8× (fine detail).

**Zoom animation:** Zoom level changes are smoothly animated over 0.25 s using a
linear interpolation each frame (not GSAP — it runs in the canvas redraw, no DOM).

**Label density adapts to zoom:**
- Zoom < 1.5×: only major objects labelled (star, planets); LIVE galleries always labelled regardless
- Zoom 1.5–3×: L5 markers, settlement domes, moons, open/idle galleries labelled
- Zoom > 3×: all objects labelled, including individual L4/L5 zones, gallery type tags, scheduled event titles

### 3.2 Pan

At zoom ≤ 1×, panning is disabled (full world visible). At zoom > 1×:

- **Mouse drag on strip:** Pans the strip viewport left/right (or up/down in surface mode).
- **Auto-follow:** When the 3D camera moves, the strip viewport gently shifts to keep the
  camera cursor in the centre third of the visible window. 3 seconds after the user's last
  manual drag, auto-follow re-engages with a 0.6 s ease-in.
- **Wrap-around:** In `system` and `surface` modes the world wraps at 0°/360°. The strip
  draws objects twice (at X and X + stripWidth) near the wrap boundary so the seam is
  invisible.

---

## 4. Hover Interaction

When the mouse hovers over an object dot in the strip, a small tooltip appears above the
strip (not below, to avoid being hidden by the bottom controls):

```
┌───────────────────────┐
│  Kepler-442b           │
│  Exoplanet · 289 K     │
│  ▲ Click → fly to      │
│  ▲ Shift+click → portal│
└───────────────────────┘
```

The tooltip shows:
- Object name and type
- One key stat (temp / distance / spectral type)
- Click action description (fly-to vs portal transit)

Hovering also highlights the corresponding object in the main 3D scene (if it has a
`THREE.Mesh` hit target) by briefly scaling it up 1.3× for 0.5 s.

---

## 5. Click Interaction — Fly-to vs Portal Transit

### 5.1 Same-level fly-to (no portal)

Clicking an object **within the current scene and level** triggers the same GSAP fly-to
animation already used in each page. The 3D camera glides toward the target. No portal.

**Same-level targets by mode:**

| Mode | Target | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `system` | Planet dot | `focusPlanet()` — GSAP camera to planet |
| `system` | L4/L5 triangle | GSAP camera to Lagrange zone |
| `system` | Star glow | Camera return to system overview |
| `system` | Moon arc | GSAP camera zoom to moon |
| `surface` | Host star | Camera yaw to face star azimuth (GSAP target orbit) |
| `surface` | Moon dot | Camera yaw to face moon azimuth |
| `surface` | Sibling planet dot | Camera yaw toward planet |
| `cosmic` | Galaxy cluster | `enterCluster()` or `zoomToXrayCluster()` |
| `cosmic` | Wormhole conduit | Open conduit panel |

### 5.2 Cross-level portal transit

Clicking an object that **requires a scene change** triggers the E8 wormhole portal sequence
(`portalStore.openPortal()`). These always cross a scene boundary and use the full 7-second
transit animation.

**Cross-level targets:**

| Mode | Target | Portal destination |
|---|---|---|
| `system` | Settlement ⬡ on planet | `/surface/:hostname/:planetName` |
| `system` | Settlement ⬡ on L5 zone | `/surface/:hostname/:planetName?zone=L5` |
| `system` | Galaxy label (breadcrumb) | `/galaxy` (exit to galaxy map) |
| `surface` | Sibling planet dot (Shift+click) | `/surface/:hostname/:siblingName` |
| `surface` | System breadcrumb | `/galaxy?focusHost=:hostname` |
| `surface` | Pyramid / transit marker | Opens transit dialog (not full portal) |
| `cosmic` | Milky Way glyph | `/galaxy` |
| `cosmic` | Conduit + destination | `/surface/:hostname/:planetName` via transit |

**The modifier key rule:** Plain click = fly-to (same level). Shift+click = portal transit
(cross level). For cross-level objects (settlement dots, breadcrumbs, galleries) there is
no same-level equivalent, so plain click triggers the appropriate action.

### 5.3 Orbital gallery access and transit

Galleries are always cross-level (they are Level 3.5, distinct from the system orbital view
at Level 3 and the surface at Level 4). Plain click on a gallery dot resolves access before
any animation fires.

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Access ✓, state `open` / `idle` / `live` | Portal zoom-in → `portalStore.openPortal()` → `/gallery/:hostname/:id` |
| Access ✓, state `live` (presenceCount > 0) | Same as above — user joins live session |
| Access ✗, state `open` | Tooltip: "Access Required · [gallery name]" + pon.ink acquire button |
| State `locked`, user not owner | Tooltip: "Session Locked by [owner]" — no portal |
| State `locked`, user is owner | Tooltip: "YOU locked this · Click to unlock" — emits `unlockGallery` |
| State `exclusive`, access ✗ | Tooltip: "NFT Required · Mint on pon.ink" + link |

**GSAP fly-to in 3D scene before portal:** When a gallery is clicked in the DefenderNav
strip and access is valid, the parent first fires a GSAP fly-to that moves the 3D camera
from its current position toward the gallery's 3D position in the orbital scene (0.8 s,
`power2.inOut`). The 3D camera motion plays in parallel with the strip's 0.28 s zoom-in
animation. The portal fires at `t = 0.38 s` when both animations have landed.

---

## 6. Portal Zoom-In Effect (Strip → Wormhole)

When a cross-level portal transit is triggered from the DefenderNav strip, there is a
**brief zoom-into-the-dot animation** before the full E8 portal overlay takes over. This
grounds the transition spatially — you are diving through the map into that location.

### 6.1 Sequence

```
t = 0.00 s  User clicks settlement ⬡ on Kepler-442b in strip
t = 0.00 s  Dot gains highlight ring (cyan glow, scale 1.5×)
t = 0.00 s  Strip zoom begins: 0.28 s ease-in-out zoom to 8× centered on dot
t = 0.20 s  Dot fills ~60 px of strip, label enlarges  
t = 0.28 s  Strip dims to black (0.1 s fade)
t = 0.38 s  `portalStore.openPortal()` called — E8 mandala begins
t = 7.38 s  Portal completes — Vue Router navigates to destination
```

### 6.2 Strip fade-to-black transition

During the 0.10 s fade, the strip canvas draws a black rectangle at increasing opacity over
the zoomed dot, creating the illusion that the camera is tunnelling into the point.

### 6.3 Cancel window

If the user clicks a second time during the 0.28 s zoom, the animation cancels and resets.
The portal does not trigger until the zoom animation completes.

---

## 7. Component Architecture

### 7.1 File: `src/components/DefenderNav.vue`

**Template:** A container div with:
- `.defender-header` — breadcrumb + zoom slider + collapse toggle
- `<canvas ref="navCanvas">` — the strip canvas
- `.defender-tooltip` — absolutely positioned tooltip (v-if)

**Props:**

```typescript
interface DefenderNavProps {
  mode:       'system' | 'surface' | 'cosmic'
  // Breadcrumb text for header
  sceneLabel: string          // e.g. "Kepler-442" or "Coma Supercluster"
}
```

**Emitted events:**

```typescript
interface DefenderNavEmits {
  // Same-level fly-to: parent executes GSAP
  flyTo: (target: DefenderTarget) => void
  // Cross-level portal: parent calls portalStore.openPortal()
  portalTo: (dest: PortalDestination) => void
}

interface DefenderTarget {
  type:    'planet' | 'lagrange' | 'moon' | 'star' | 'azimuth' | 'cluster' | 'gallery'
  id:      string          // planet name, cluster name, gallery name, etc.
  angle?:  number          // orbital angle (system mode)
  radius?: number          // orbital radius (system mode)
  azimuth?: number         // azimuth degrees (surface mode)
  // Gallery-specific fields (set when type === 'gallery')
  galleryId?:    string
  hostname?:     string
  accessLevel?:  GalleryAccessLevel
  meetingState?: GalleryMeetingState
}
```

### 7.2 Parent integration pattern

Each page that uses DefenderNav:

```typescript
// In the parent page script setup:
const defenderNav = ref<InstanceType<typeof DefenderNav> | null>(null)

// In the Three.js tick loop (already running at 60 fps):
function tick() {
  // ... existing three.js logic ...

  // DefenderNav redraw (same tick, no extra RAF)
  defenderNav.value?.redraw(buildDefenderData())
}

// Handler for fly-to events from the strip
function onDefenderFlyTo(target: DefenderTarget) {
  if (target.type === 'planet')  focusPlanet(findPlanetMesh(target.id))
  else if (target.type === 'lagrange') flyToLagrangePoint(target)
  else if (target.type === 'gallery')  handleGalleryTarget(target)
  // etc.
}

function handleGalleryTarget(target: DefenderTarget) {
  if (target.meetingState === 'locked' && target.accessLevel !== 'owner') return
  if (target.accessLevel === 'none') return   // tooltip shown by DefenderNav, no portal
  // GSAP fly-to gallery 3D position + portal (fires in parallel with strip zoom-in)
  const galPos = galleryWorldPos(target.galleryId!)
  gsap.to(camera.position, { duration: 0.8, ...galPos, ease: 'power2.inOut',
    onUpdate: () => controls.update() })
  portalStore.openPortal({ label: target.id,
    route: `/gallery/${target.hostname}/${target.galleryId}` })
}

// Handler for portal events from the strip
function onDefenderPortalTo(dest: PortalDestination) {
  portalStore.openPortal(dest)
}
```

```html
<!-- In the parent template -->
<DefenderNav
  ref="defenderNav"
  :mode="mode === 'system' ? 'system' : 'galaxy'"
  :sceneLabel="currentSystem?.hostname ?? 'Galaxy'"
  @flyTo="onDefenderFlyTo"
  @portalTo="onDefenderPortalTo"
/>
```

## 8. Internal Canvas Drawing Pipeline

Called by `redraw(data)` — no Vue reactivity, pure canvas API.

```
redraw(data)
  │
  ├─ clear canvas (fillRect black)
  ├─ drawScanLines()              thin horizontal stripes, 2px period
  ├─ drawScaleRuler()             right edge
  │
  ├─ [system mode]
  │   ├─ drawOrbitRings()         dashed lines at each planet radius; amber for P-type
  │   ├─ drawGalleryOrbitRings()  faint dotted lines at each gallery orbital radius
  │   ├─ drawForbiddenZone()      hatched band if circumbinary/hierarchical_triple
  │   ├─ drawStars()              dispatches to one of:
  │   │     drawSingleStar()        single glow at barycentre
  │   │     drawTightBinaryPair()   two co-rotating glows near barycentre
  │   │     drawWideCompanion()     companion glow at its orbital radius/angle
  │   │     drawOuterCompanion()    trinary outer star glow at very wide radius
  │   │     drawContactBinary()     merged elongated glow with pulse
  │   ├─ drawPlanets()            dot + glow + ⟡ badge on P-type planets
  │   ├─ drawLagrangeMarkers()    ▲L4, ▽L5 triangles tracking planet angles
  │   ├─ drawMoonArcs()           dashed arc around each planet dot
  │   ├─ drawSettlementMarkers()  ⬡ hexagon on planets with settlement
  │   ├─ drawGalleryStations()    ⬠ rotating diamonds; dispatches per meetingState:
  │   │     drawGalleryIdle()       dim static diamond
  │   │     drawGalleryOpen()       normal diamond, slow rotation
  │   │     drawGalleryLive()       bright diamond, fast rotation, outer ring pulse,
  │   │                             presence count badge [n]
  │   │     drawGalleryLocked()     outline only, ✖ badge, no rotation
  │   │     drawGalleryExclusive()  outline + ⚿ badge
  │   │     drawScheduledBeacon()   dashed orbit ring brightening toward event start
  │   └─ drawCameraCursor()       blinking ▽ at camera angle/radius (from barycentre)
  │
  ├─ [surface mode]
  │   ├─ drawTerrainLine()        jagged horizon silhouette
  │   ├─ drawSkyObjects()         dots at (azimuth→X, altitude→Y); handles all types
  │   │     — star/companion:       glow dots, binary pair overlap logic
  │   │     — gallery:             tiny ⬠ diamond at skyAzimuth/skyAltitude;
  │   │                            LIVE galleries carry outer pulse ring in sky strip
  │   ├─ drawCameraFovBracket()   vertical cursor + FOV bracket at camera azimuth
  │   └─ drawSettlementAnchor()   ⬡ at azimuth 0, altitude 0
  │
  └─ [cosmic mode]
      ├─ drawVoidArcs()           partial circles for void shells
      ├─ drawClusters()           dots sized by richness
      ├─ drawConduits()           ◆ pulsing diamonds
      ├─ drawEventBeacons()       glow rings
      └─ drawCameraCursor()       ◇ at camera XZ position
```

All drawing uses `ctx.save() / ctx.restore()` bracketing. No state leaks between draw calls.

**Scan-line effect:**
```javascript
for (let y = 0; y < H; y += 2) {
  ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07)'
  ctx.fillRect(0, y, W, 1)
}
```

**Blinking cursor:** The cursor blinks at 1.4 Hz. Blink state = `Math.floor(t * 2.8) % 2`.
When blink state = 0, cursor opacity is 1.0. When blink state = 1, opacity is 0.35.

**Wrap-around drawing:** For world-wrapping modes (system orbital angle, surface azimuth),
objects near 0°/360° are drawn twice — once at their true X and once at X ± stripWidth —
so the seam is never visible. Only objects within `[viewOffset - padding, viewOffset + stripWidth + padding]`
are drawn.

---

## 9. Aesthetic Standards

The strip should feel like:
> *A 1980s vector-scan radar readout running inside a spacecraft that also happens to know
> about real NASA exoplanet data.*

Rules:
- **No filled rectangles except background** — all objects are glows, dots, arcs, or lines.
- **No colour fills on orbit rings** — dashed strokes only.
- **Monospace font only** — `'Courier New', monospace` — for all labels.
- **Font sizes:** 7 px (tick labels), 8 px (standard labels), 10 px (current-object label).
- **Letter-spacing:** 0.07em on all labels.
- **No drop shadows** — use `ctx.globalCompositeOperation = 'screen'` for glows instead.
- **Glow technique:** draw the same shape twice — once large at 15% opacity (soft glow),
  once small at 90% opacity (hard core). Never use CSS filters on canvas.
- **Colour palette:**
  - Background: `#010810`
  - Grid / rings: `rgba(30, 70, 110, 0.4)`
  - Camera cursor: `#00e5ff` (same as wormhole conduit colour)
  - L5 marker: `rgba(255, 180, 30, 0.8)` (matches pyramid amber)
  - L4 marker: `rgba(60, 220, 100, 0.75)` (eco-ops green)
  - Settlement dome: `rgba(0, 200, 220, 0.9)` (same as dome in SurfaceViewPage)
  - Gallery — art: `rgba(200, 120, 255, 0.9)` violet
  - Gallery — community: `rgba(255, 200, 60, 0.9)` gold
  - Gallery — research: `rgba(60, 220, 180, 0.9)` teal

## 10. Accessibility & Performance

### 10.1 Reduce-motion

If `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is detected:
- Cursor blink suppressed (stays at full opacity)
- Strip zoom animation instant (no easing)
- Portal zoom-in animation skipped (portal triggers immediately)

### 10.2 Mobile / touch

- Strip height reduced to 64 px.
- Touch drag pans the strip (one finger).
- Pinch zooms the strip.
- Tap opens tooltip. Second tap on same object triggers fly-to or portal.
- Strip collapses to 20 px on portrait screens < 400 px wide; expands on tap.

### 10.3 Performance budget

- `redraw()` must complete in < 3 ms per call (measured with `performance.now()`).
- Maximum 300 objects drawn per frame. If more exist (X-ray clusters in cosmic mode):
  use spatial hashing to cull objects outside the visible strip viewport before drawing.
- No new allocations inside `redraw()` — all arrays pre-allocated on mount; reuse buffers.
- `ctx.save() / ctx.restore()` calls capped at 20 per frame to avoid stack pressure.

## 11. Integration Points with Existing System

| Existing system | DefenderNav touch point |
|---|---|
| `portalStore.openPortal()` | Called by parent `onDefenderPortalTo` handler |
| `WormholePortal.vue` | Unchanged — portal triggers same 7-second E8 sequence |
| GSAP fly-to in GalaxyPage | Called by parent `onDefenderFlyTo` handler |
| OrbitControls | Not directly touched — GSAP drives camera, controls follow |
| `NavigatorInset` | Remains in place — different role (inset context diagram vs strip navigator) |
| `events.ts` / `COSMIC_EVENTS` | Event clusters shown in cosmic mode with beacon rings |
| `starColorFromTeff()` | Used for star dot colours in all modes |
| `planetColor()` | Used for planet dot colours in system + surface modes |
| `sy_snum` + known-circumbinary set | Resolved into `StellarConfig` by a `resolveStellarConfig(sys)` helper in GalaxyPage before `redraw()` — DefenderNav never reads `sy_snum` directly |
| Binary orbital angle | Animated in GalaxyPage tick loop: `binaryAngle += (2π / periodDays) × dtDays`; passed as `stellarConfig.innerBinary.angle` each frame |
| Companion teff estimation | If no companion teff in data: estimated as `primaryTeff × 0.72` (typical K/M companion heuristic); flagged as `estimated: true` for tooltip disclosure |
| pon.ink auth / wallet NFT inventory | Parent page resolves `GalleryAccessLevel` per gallery before each `redraw()` by checking the user's wallet holdings against gallery deed + membership NFT addresses — DefenderNav receives pre-resolved `accessLevel`, never calls pon.ink directly |
| `GalleryPage.vue` (`/gallery` route) | Existing page extended to accept `/:hostname/:galleryId` params; DefenderNav portal destination targets this route |
| Gallery meeting state | Polled or subscribed from pon.ink API by parent page on system entry; updated in `OrbitalGalleryEntry.meetingState` before each `redraw()` — not polled inside DefenderNav |
| `COSMIC_EVENTS` / scheduled events | `scheduledEvent` field on `OrbitalGalleryEntry` mirrors event data from `events.ts`; strip shows countdown beacon brightening to `live` state |
| `exolocation-types.json` / `orbital_zone` type | Gallery Deed NFT address uses `exo-orbital-gallery-v1:` prefix, consistent with exolocation coordinate system `orbital_zone` type already in the schema |

## 12. Future Scope (out of v1.1)

- **Multiplayer presence:** In surface mode, show other users' camera look-directions as
  coloured cursor lines in the strip — so you can see where community members are looking.
- **Event timeline strip:** Overlay a second horizontal strip for time (UTC hours) instead
  of space — switching the strip to a chronometer mode showing event dots across the day.
  Uses the same scan-line aesthetic but X = time rather than azimuth.
- **Wormhole conduit path tracing:** In cosmic mode, draw the path of a conduit transit
  as an animated dashed line moving from source cluster to destination cluster before the
  portal fires.
- **Terrain silhouette from real data:** Replace the noise-generated terrain line in surface
  mode with a procedural heightmap computed from the planet's orbital parameters (eqt, rade,
  insol) — giving each planet a visually distinctive ridge profile.
- **Gallery interior floor plan mode:** When inside GalleryPage (Level 3.5), the strip
  switches to a 2D top-down floor plan view — rooms = zones across the X-axis, depth =
  Y-axis, artworks / info nodes = labeled dots, viewer position = cursor. Clicking a room
  dot in the strip triggers a smooth pan to that room in the gallery 3D scene.
- **DAO vote indicator:** When a cooperative or DAO gallery has a pending governance vote
  (e.g. curating new content, updating access policy), show a small vote-beacon ⚖ badge
  on the gallery diamond in the strip, with tooltip showing vote deadline and current tally.
- **Cross-system gallery network map:** In a future `network` mode, the strip shows all
  galleries the current user has access to across every star system — sorted by scheduled
  event time, letting the user jump directly from the strip to any live session system-wide.
