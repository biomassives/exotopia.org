      {
        question: 'What pH range is generally considered safe for drinking water?',
        options: ['4.0 – 6.0', '6.5 – 8.5', '9.0 – 11.0', '3.0 – 5.0'],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'WHO guidelines recommend pH 6.5–8.5 for drinking water. Values outside this range indicate acidity or alkalinity that can affect taste and health.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Turbidity measures which quality of water?',
        options: ['Temperature', 'Chemical contamination', 'Cloudiness / suspended particles', 'Dissolved oxygen'],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: 'Turbidity is the measure of water clarity — how much light is scattered by suspended particles (sediment, bacteria, algae). It is measured in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units).',

      {
        question: 'In a WATSAN field reading, which parameter most directly indicates faecal contamination?',
        options: ['pH', 'Turbidity', 'Nitrate', 'E. coli / coliform count'],
        correct: 3,
        explanation: 'E. coli is a specific indicator of faecal contamination. Its presence means the water has been in contact with animal or human waste and should not be consumed untreated.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the primary purpose of logging GPS coordinates with a water quality reading?',
        options: ['Artistic documentation', 'Tamper-evident on-chain provenance and spatial analysis', 'Satisfying app requirements', 'Estimating travel time'],
        correct: 1,

        options: ['Synthetic fertiliser', 'Organic matter that improves soil structure and nutrient content', 'Pesticides', 'Irrigation water'],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Composting decomposes organic waste (food scraps, plant material) into humus — a rich organic matter that improves soil structure, water retention, and provides nutrients to plants without synthetic chemicals.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why is crop rotation important?',
        options: ['It is purely traditional practice', 'It prevents soil nutrient depletion and breaks pest cycles', 'It requires less water', 'It reduces the number of crops needed'],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Different crops use and return different nutrients. Legumes fix nitrogen; others deplete it. Rotation prevents the build-up of crop-specific pests and diseases while maintaining soil fertility.',

      {
        question: 'What makes an eco-ops field reading "tamper-evident"?',
        options: ['It is stored on paper', 'GPS + timestamp + on-chain hash create a verifiable record that cannot be changed retroactively', 'Admin approval', 'Photograph attachment'],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'When a reading is submitted, a hash of its data (GPS, timestamp, measurement values) is stored on-chain. Any change to the data would produce a different hash, revealing tampering.',

        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Consent is not "I agree this is the best option" but "I can live with this and it won\'t harm us." This lowers the bar for moving forward while still protecting against serious harm — much faster than full consensus.',
      },
      {
        question: 'In the Ecommunity DAO, how do members earn governance tokens?',
        options: ['By purchasing them on an exchange', 'Through participation, facilitation, and mentorship within the community', 'Automatically at registration', 'Only through financial investment'],
        correct: 1,
