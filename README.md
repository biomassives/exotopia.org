## What it is

Exotopia is a navigable universe for the SCD Hub ecosystem. Users descend from the cosmic web — galaxy clusters, great voids, supercluster filaments — all the way to a settlement surface on a confirmed exoplanet, exomoon, or orbital habitat. Each level of the descent corresponds to a real scale of astronomical structure. The numbers at each level are from published catalogs.

The platform is the cosmic layer of three interconnected tools:

| Platform | Function |
|---|---|
| **exotopia.org** | Cosmic visualization, virtual real estate, settlement environments |
| **pon.ink** | Sound tools, events, M-Pesa/Stripe payments, NFT minting, user dashboard |
| **ecocity.com** | Sustainable infrastructure design, vocational education, settlement objects |

Real-world eco-ops field work, community development activities, and cultural production earn virtual real estate — settlements at real exoplanets and other astronomical objects.

## Architecture

### Renderer

A singleton `WebGLRenderer` lives at module scope in `src/composables/useVizRenderer.ts`. It is initialised once by `MainLayout.vue` and shared across all visualization pages. Each page:
1. On mount — creates a `pageGroup`, adds scene objects to it, calls `viz.addTick(fn)` to register a per-frame callback
2. On unmount — disposes geometries/materials, removes `pageGroup` from scene, unregisters tick

This means navigation between visualization pages does not tear down and recreate the WebGL context. Camera position is preserved across route transitions. There is no visual flash or reload.

### Settlement pipeline

Three-stage deterministic pipeline seeded by galaxy cluster ID:
1. **Stellar populations** — star count, spectral mix, binary fraction from cluster mass estimate
2. **Orbital architecture** — planet count, period distribution, stability filter
3. **Planet composition** — radius/mass/temperature → bulk composition → surface type

Output: 2,823 galaxies → 7,096 star systems → 10,900 generated planets. All stable across sessions (same seed = same output). When real catalog data exists for an object, it replaces the generated layer. The route and page component are identical; the data source is what changes.

### Coordinate system

One coordinate frame from the cosmic web to a settlement surface:
- **Comoving Mpc** — cosmic level (1 scene unit = 15 Mpc in CosmosPage/CosmicPage)
- **Parsecs / light-years** — GalaxyPage star positions (HYG RA/Dec/distance)
- **Equilibrium temperature + orbital parameters** — SurfaceViewPage terrain and sky
- **Surface lat/lon** — PON INK `surface_polygon` exolocation coordinate type

## Working assumptions (updated June 2026)

### Changed from earlier assumptions

**Single renderer, not per-page canvases.** The original design created a new WebGL context on every page mount. The phase2 branch replaced this with a singleton renderer in `useVizRenderer`. All visualization pages share one context. This was necessary to eliminate the context-limit exhaustion on modern browsers and to enable seamless camera continuity across route transitions.

**WelcomePage is the cosmic entry point.** What was a landing page with navigation buttons to separate cosmic and galaxy views is now the first level of the navigable universe. The rename to `CosmosPage` reflects this. A `WelcomeOverlay` component handles role-specific messaging without blocking the 3D scene.

**Orbital zone and exomoon settlements are in schema, not in scene.** The PON INK exolocation schema already supports `orbital_zone` and surface coordinates for moons (`parent` param). The Three.js scenes for these settlement types do not yet exist. `StationPage.vue` exists at `/station` but its scene is a placeholder. This is a known gap — see SPEC_COSMOS_ENTRY.md.

**Black holes are metadata, not destinations.** Black hole masses and types are stored on named cluster `brightGalaxies` entries. There is no route or scene for approaching a black hole. The decorative BH geometry in CosmosPage is illustrative. An enterable BH scene (Schwarzschild radius, photon sphere, accretion disk geometry) is planned.

**Sky accuracy is unresolved.** The surface view star field uses the Earth-viewpoint HYG catalog. For settlements within 200 ly this is approximately correct. Beyond that, the constellations visible from a settlement differ from Earth's. A per-settlement sky catalog generator (Python, offline, using galactic coordinate transforms) is specced but not built.

**Oracle-generated galaxies are clearly labelled.** The 26,225 member galaxies generated by the oracle pipeline are statistically representative of their cluster type. They are not catalog data. Every oracle galaxy is labelled as generated in its detail panel. When real member data is added for a cluster (NED API query), it replaces the oracle layer without changing the route.

### Stable assumptions

- GPL v3. Community owns its data. On-chain records are public.
- Real data always takes precedence over generated data. Generated data is clearly labelled.
- Accessibility first: every feature reachable on mid-range Android at 3G.
- Culture is the vehicle: music, visual art, and spatial storytelling are not decoration.
- 80% of settlement revenue to settlement owner. 15% to SCD Hub treasury. 5% to platform.
- E8 lattice wormhole transit as the narrative mechanic for long-distance navigation.

## Developer setup

```bash
npm install
npx quasar dev          # dev server at http://localhost:9000
npx quasar build        # production build to dist/spa/
npx vue-tsc --noEmit    # TypeScript check (one pre-existing deprecation warning is expected)
```

Node 18+ required. Quasar v2 / Vite v2 / Vue 3 / TypeScript.

### Environment

No environment variables required for local development. The app runs entirely client-side (SPA). Galaxy data loads from `public/exoapril2_2024.json` (~17 MB). X-ray cluster data loads from `public/clusters-xray.json` (~250 KB).
